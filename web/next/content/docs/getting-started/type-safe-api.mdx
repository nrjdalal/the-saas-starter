## Type-Safe API Client

This starter utilizes [Hono RPC](https://hono.dev/docs/guides/rpc) to provide end-to-end type safety between the backend and frontend.

- **Backend**: Routes defined in `api/hono/src/routers` are exported as `AppType` at `api/hono/src/index.ts`.
- **Frontend**: The client at `web/next/src/lib/api/client.ts` infers `AppType` request/response types using `hono/client`.

### Usage Example

```ts
import { apiClient } from "@/lib/api/client"

// Fully typed request and response
const res = await apiClient.health.$get()
const data = await res.json()
```
