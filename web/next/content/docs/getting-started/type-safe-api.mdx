description: Learn how to use the type-safe API client with Hono RPC.
---

## Overview

ZeroStarter leverages Hono RPC to provide end-to-end type safety between the backend API and frontend client. This ensures that API calls are fully typed, catching errors at compile time and providing excellent developer experience with autocomplete and type checking.

## Type-Safe API Client

This starter utilizes [Hono RPC](https://hono.dev/docs/guides/rpc) to provide end-to-end type safety between the backend and frontend.

- **Backend**: Routes defined in `api/hono/src/routers` are exported as `AppType` at `api/hono/src/index.ts`.
- **Frontend**: The client at `web/next/src/lib/api/client.ts` infers `AppType` request/response types using `hono/client`.

### Usage Example

```ts
import { apiClient } from "@/lib/api/client"

// Fully typed request and response
const res = await apiClient.health.$get()
const data = await res.json()
```
