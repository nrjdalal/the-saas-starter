## Overview

We welcome contributions to ZeroStarter! This guide outlines the process for contributing code, documentation, and other improvements to the project. Following these guidelines helps ensure a smooth review process and maintains code quality.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome — any help is appreciated!

- Fork the repo and create a branch (use descriptive names, e.g. `feat/{name}` or `fix/{name}`).
- Make your changes, add tests if applicable, and run the checks:
  - `bun run build`
  - `bun run check-types`
  - `bun run format`
  - `bun run lint`
- Follow the existing code style and commit message conventions (use conventional commits: feat, fix, docs, chore).
- Open a PR describing the change, motivation, and any migration notes; link related issues.
- For breaking changes or large features, open an issue first to discuss the approach.
- By contributing you agree to the MIT license and the project's Code of Conduct.

Thank you for helping improve ZeroStarter!
